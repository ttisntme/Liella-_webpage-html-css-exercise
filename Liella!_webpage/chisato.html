            <span class="ctext3">Chisato is Kanon's childhood friend who is good at breakdancing. She belongs to Yuigaoka's music program, much to the dismay of Kanon. She is an energetic girl who can easily befriend anyone she meets. Chisato has taken an interest in Kanon's pet Manmaru, who seems to be wary around Chisato when she comes to visit. She is also known to keep up to date on gossip and rumors that are spread around the school. Despite having an interest in school idols, Chisato initially does not want to become one as she thinks she is better off supporting Kanon instead. She has a part time job at a takoyaki shop, which is also her favorite food. She is distinguishable with her twin tail hairstyle and hair buns.</span><br>---> wikipedia<br>
