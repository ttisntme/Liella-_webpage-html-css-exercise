            <span class="ctext4">Sumire is a posh shrine maiden who lives at a well-known and respected community shrine located near the school. She was a former child actress who struggled to receive headlining roles in any project she worked on. Because of her experience in the world of show business, she expected to take the position of center within Liella!, eventually being voted in last place with Kanon taking the lead. Her catchphrase is "Galaxy!"</span><br>---> wikipedia<br>
