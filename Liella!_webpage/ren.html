            <span class="ctext5">Ren is the daughter of the school founder, as well as the student council president. She also belongs to the music program alongside Chisato. Initially, she is unfriendly and strict towards the school idol club, doing everything in her power to shut down opportunities that come by. She lives nearby the school, and takes pride in the rich history of Yuigaoka. She is polite, disciplined, and known for her strict personality. However, she is not well versed in technology, being advised when she was younger to not spend too much time online. Her favorite foods are consommé, strawberries, and Darjeeling tea.</span><br>---> wikipedia<br>
