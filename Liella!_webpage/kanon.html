            <span class="ctext1">Kanon is a high school first-year student who claims to be "someone with no stand out characteristics." 
            Kanon also helps her mother run her cafe, and one of her specialties is latte art. 
            She keeps a chubby Eurasian scops owl as a pet named "Manmaru," which is also the cafe's popular mascot. 
            She has a fond appreciation for both singing and playing guitar. 
            However, she tends to tense up when she is set to perform in front of other people, which has caused her to pass out on several occasions on stage. 
            Due to this, she failed the entrance exam for Yuigaoka Girls' music program, and ended up settling for the school's general academic program instead. 
            She wears glasses and ties her hair up when at home.</span><br>---> wikipedia<br>
